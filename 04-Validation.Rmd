# Validation

To validate our claims that both vectors create samples that match the truncated triangular distribution, a few hypothesis tests are in order.

First, we validate that the sample mean and the distribution mean match; second, we evaluate whether their variance matches. If both these tests are passed, we perform a goodness of fit test. Specifically, a _Kolmogorov-Smirnof_ test and a _Chi-Square test_.
