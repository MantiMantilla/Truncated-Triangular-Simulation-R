# Simulation and Validation.

So far we have designed two constructor functions, `generate.triangular()` and `generate.truncated.triangular()`, with which we may create triangular distributions and truncated triangular distributions respectively. We now may want to validate our implementation. An easy method to validate our functions that calculate descriptive statistics or the pdf is to use it as a means to generate a random sample 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
